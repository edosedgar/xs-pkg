Shortest path on a graph with strangely defined weights: version I
Task
We are given a directed graph G=(V,E) and a source node s in V. The graph has weighted edges, and the weights are defined in the following way: for each edge (p,q), its weight is 1 iff the minimum number of edges to traverse to get from s to p in graph G is an even number (including 0), otherwise its weight is 2. In so weighted graph, given a destination node t, compute the shortest path from s to t using Dijkstra's algorithm with "early exit" strategy.

Input:
Input file named input.txt is formatted as follows:
1st line: number of vertices n=|V| (single positive integer)
2nd line: number of edges m=|E| (single positive integer)
3rd line: index of source node s
4th line: indexes of destination node t
following m lines: pairs of vertices representing edges, separated by a space, where vertices are numbered from 0 to n-1

Output:
Output file named output.txt should contain a single number: cost of the shortest path from s to t

Technical remarks
For implementing priority queue, you are not allowed to use a standard library, you have to implement it yourself.

Standard input/output is not supported, respect names input.txt and output.txt for input and output files respectively.
